Proportions: Ensure that the proportions of the figures and objects are more accurate and consistent. Study human and animal anatomy to better understand how to depict them realistically. 2. Textures: Add more detailed textures to elements like grass, water, and clothing. This can be achieved by using different shading techniques and paying attention to the way light interacts with surfaces. 3. Lighting: Apply consistent lighting throughout the scenes. Determine a light source and use it to create shadows and highlights, which will add depth and dimension to the artwork. 4. Perspective: Use perspective techniques to create a sense of depth and space. This can involve using vanishing points and horizon lines to ensure that objects and figures are placed correctly in the scene. 5. Details: Incorporate more details into the scenes, such as facial features, folds in clothing, and individual blades of grass. This will make the scenes more lifelike and engaging. 6. Color: Use a wider range of colors and shades to create more realistic and vibrant scenes. Pay attention to how colors change in different lighting conditions and environments.", "current": "To improve the realism of the artwork, consider focusing on the following aspects: 1.
