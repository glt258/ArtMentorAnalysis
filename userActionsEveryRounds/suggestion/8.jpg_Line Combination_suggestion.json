Introduce varying line weights to add depth and dimension to the figures and background. Thicker lines can be used for the foreground elements (children) and thinner lines for the background elements (fireworks, airplanes) to create a sense of perspective. 3. Refine the lines in the dresses to ensure they are more consistent and harmonious with the overall composition. This can involve smoothing out any jagged or uneven lines and ensuring the patterns on the dresses flow naturally. 4. Consider adding more detailed line work to the fireworks to enhance their texture and movement, making them appear more dynamic and lively. 5.
