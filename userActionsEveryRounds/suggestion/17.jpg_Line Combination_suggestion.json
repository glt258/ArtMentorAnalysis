Enhance the cohesion where lines intersect or overlap by using smoother transitions or blending techniques. This will help create a more harmonious composition. 2. Vary the line thickness to add depth and dimension to different elements, such as the dragons, birds, and people. Thicker lines can be used for foreground elements, while thinner lines can be used for background details. 3. Use consistent line styles for similar elements to maintain visual coherence. For example, the clouds and sun could benefit from a uniform line style to tie them together. 4. Experiment with different line directions and curves to add dynamism and movement to the scene. This can make the artwork more engaging and lively. 5. Pay attention to the negative space created by the lines. Ensure that the spaces between the lines contribute to the overall balance and composition of the piece.", "current": "To improve the line combinations in the artwork, consider the following: 1.
