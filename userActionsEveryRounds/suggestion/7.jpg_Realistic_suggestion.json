Use a combination of short and long strokes to mimic the natural flow of the fur. 2. **Facial Features**: Enhance the details of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Adding reflections in the eyes and more defined lines around the nose and mouth can make the face more expressive and realistic. 3. **Lighting and Shadows**: Introduce more defined lighting and shadows to give the image depth. Pay attention to the light source and how it affects different parts of the dog's body. 4. **Proportions and Anatomy**: Ensure the proportions of the dog's body parts are accurate. Study reference images to understand the anatomy better. 5. **Sharpness and Clarity**: While watercolor can create a soft effect, try to balance it with sharper lines in key areas to enhance clarity. 6. **Background Elements**: Adding subtle background elements can provide context and make the image more dynamic without detracting from the main subject. 7. **Color Variations**: Introduce slight variations in color within the fur to add depth and dimension. This can be achieved by layering different shades of the same color.
