Enhance the shading and blending of colors to create a more cohesive integration of lines. This can be achieved by using softer transitions between different shades and ensuring that the lines blend seamlessly with the colors. 2. Add more detailed line work to the house and the dog to bring out finer details and textures. This will add depth and realism to the scene. 3. Refine the lines on the green blanket and the yarn balls to make them more consistent and uniform. This will help in maintaining the overall balance and harmony of the composition. 4.
