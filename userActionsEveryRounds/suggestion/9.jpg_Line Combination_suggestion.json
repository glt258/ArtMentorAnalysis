Enhance Cohesion: Ensure that the lines connecting different elements are more cohesive. This can be achieved by using similar line styles or thicknesses where elements intersect. 2. Consistent Flow: Maintain a consistent flow of lines throughout the piece to guide the viewer's eye smoothly across the artwork. 3. Balance Line Density: Balance the density of lines in different areas to avoid overcrowding in some parts while leaving others sparse. 4. Integrate Elements: Use lines to better integrate the various elements, such as the airplane, sun, and children, creating a more unified composition. 5. Harmonize Colors: Harmonize the colors of the lines to create a more visually appealing and less jarring effect. This can be done by using complementary or analogous color schemes. 6.
