Enhance the cohesion of lines in the background by ensuring that the lines defining the rainbow and clouds are more consistent and less intersected by other elements.

Thicker lines can be used for the main outlines, while thinner lines can be used for details. 3. Ensure that the lines defining the characters' features and clothing are smooth and continuous to avoid any disjointed appearance. 4. Integrate more curved lines to create a sense of movement and fluidity, especially in the characters' poses and the flow of the rainbow. 5. Pay attention to the alignment of lines where different elements meet, such as where the characters' arms intersect with the background, to maintain a harmonious composition.
