{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the realism of the artwork, focus on refining the proportions and details of the figures. Study human anatomy to ensure the children\u2019s bodies and faces are more accurately depicted. Enhance the textures by adding more detailed shading and highlights to create depth. Pay attention to the lighting source and apply consistent shadows and highlights to give a three-dimensional effect. Improve the perspective by using vanishing points and horizon lines to create a more realistic spatial relationship between the elements. Additionally, refine the details of the airplane and other objects to make them more lifelike. Practice using reference images to better capture realistic details and proportions.", "current": "To improve the realism of the artwork, focus on refining the proportions and details of the figures.
