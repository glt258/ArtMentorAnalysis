{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the realism of the artwork, consider the following suggestions: 1. Proportions: Work on the proportions of the figures, ensuring that heads, limbs, and bodies are accurately sized relative to each other. 2. Textures: Add more detailed textures to the clothing, skin, and other elements to enhance the lifelike quality. 3. Lighting: Use lighting and shading to create depth and dimension, making the scene appear more three-dimensional. 4. Perspective: Improve the perspective to add depth to the scene, making objects in the background appear smaller and those in the foreground larger. 5. Details: Incorporate finer details in the environment, such as more realistic flowers and grass, to add to the overall realism. 6. Color Gradation: Use color gradation to create a more natural look, especially in the sky and the airplane. 7. Anatomical Accuracy: Study human anatomy to ensure that the figures' poses and movements are realistic.", "current": "To improve the realism of the artwork, consider the following suggestions: 1.
