{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the deformation dimension, consider integrating the floating meat more cohesively into the scene. This could be achieved by adding elements that interact with the meat, such as characters reacting to it or additional surreal objects that create a more unified whimsical atmosphere. Additionally, refining the proportions and positions of the characters to enhance their exaggerated features while maintaining a sense of balance in the composition could further strengthen the overall impact. You might also explore the Egyptian frontal painting method, which uses a unique approach to human body proportions, to add a historical and artistic layer to the deformation.", "current": "To improve the deformation dimension, consider integrating the floating meat more cohesively into the scene.
