{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the deformation dimension in the artwork, consider applying the same exaggerated and whimsical style used for the figures to other elements in the scene, such as the airplane and flowers. This will create a more cohesive and unified composition. Additionally, experimenting with more varied and dynamic deformations for the background elements, like the mountains, could enhance the overall sense of movement and energy in the piece. Incorporating elements of Egyptian frontal painting, such as the use of profile views for faces and a more stylized, flat representation of bodies, could add an interesting historical and cultural layer to the deformation style.", "current": "To improve the deformation dimension in the artwork, consider applying the same exaggerated and whimsical style used for the figures to other elements in the scene, such as the airplane and flowers.
