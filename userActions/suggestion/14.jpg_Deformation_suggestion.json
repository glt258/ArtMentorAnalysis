{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the deformation dimension in the artwork, consider refining the transitions between the exaggerated and normal proportions. For instance, ensure that the elongated limbs and necks blend more seamlessly with the rest of the body to avoid a disjointed appearance. Additionally, maintaining consistent deformation across all characters can enhance the overall cohesiveness. Experimenting with varying degrees of deformation in different parts of the characters, such as slightly less exaggerated necks and more pronounced limb elongation, might also create a more balanced and engaging visual effect. Drawing inspiration from Egyptian frontal painting, you could incorporate a more uniform and stylized approach to the deformation, ensuring that the characters' proportions are exaggerated in a consistent and harmonious manner. This could involve using a more structured and geometric style to the deformation, similar to the way figures are depicted in ancient Egyptian art, where the proportions are stylized yet balanced.", "current": "To improve the deformation dimension in the artwork, consider refining the transitions between the exaggerated and normal proportions.
