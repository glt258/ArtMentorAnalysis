{"suggestions": {"original": "To enhance the deformation dimension, consider further exaggerating the forms and movements of the figures and the dragon. Integrate the abstract shapes more seamlessly with the main elements by blending their colors and forms. Experiment with varying the thickness and curvature of lines to create a more fluid and dynamic composition. Additionally, adding more layers of overlapping elements can create depth and a sense of continuous motion, enhancing the overall impact of the artwork. You might also explore incorporating elements of Egyptian frontal painting, where the upper body is depicted frontally and the lower body in profile, to add a unique and expressive touch to the figures.", "current": "To enhance the deformation dimension, consider further exaggerating the forms and movements of the figures and the dragon.
