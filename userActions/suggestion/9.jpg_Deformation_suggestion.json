{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the deformation dimension in this artwork, consider further integrating the abstract lines and disproportionate sizes of the children with the overall composition. This can be achieved by ensuring that the exaggerated elements, such as the airplane and the sun, are more cohesively connected to the children and their surroundings. For instance, the abstract lines could be used to create a more unified flow that ties the children, the airplane, and the sun together, enhancing the sense of movement and energy. Additionally, experimenting with varying the sizes of the children in a more deliberate manner could help in creating a more harmonious and balanced composition. Drawing inspiration from Egyptian frontal painting, you could emphasize the ornamental value of the children's upper bodies while using side views for the lower bodies to clearly express the hips and legs. This method of distorting the size relationship can enhance the expressiveness and visibility of the picture.", "current": "To improve the deformation dimension in this artwork, consider further integrating the abstract lines and disproportionate sizes of the children with the overall composition.
