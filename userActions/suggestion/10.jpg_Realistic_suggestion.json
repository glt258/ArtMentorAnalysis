Study human anatomy to ensure that the limbs, torso, and head are accurately depicted. Enhance the textures by adding more details to the skin, hair, and clothing. Work on the lighting and shading to create a more three-dimensional effect, paying attention to the light source and how it affects the figures and the dragon. Additionally, consider using more natural colors for the figures while maintaining the vibrant colors of the dragon to balance realism with creativity. Practice perspective techniques to ensure that all elements in the artwork are consistently aligned.", "current": "To improve the realism of the artwork, focus on refining the proportions and anatomy of the human figures.
