{"suggestions": {"original": "To improve the color contrast in the artwork, consider the following suggestions: 1. Increase the contrast between the characters' clothing and the background. For example, use darker shades for the characters' clothing if the background is bright, or vice versa. 2. Enhance the contrast between the elements in the sky, such as making the clouds a lighter shade of yellow or white to stand out more against the blue sky. 3. Use complementary colors to make certain elements pop. For instance, the green shirt could be contrasted with a red or orange background element. 4. Add more shading and highlights to the characters and objects to create a more three-dimensional effect and make them stand out more against the background. 5. Consider using a color wheel to identify contrasting colors that can be used to make the artwork more visually striking.", "current": "To improve the color contrast in the artwork, consider the following suggestions: 1.
