The left side is currently crowded with multiple figures, while the right side has a large red background with a blue section and a fish, creating a stark contrast. You could balance the composition by either adding more elements to the right side or reducing the number of elements on the left. Additionally, repositioning the half sun to a more central location or integrating it with other elements could help create a more cohesive and engaging composition. Experimenting with the placement and size of the elements can also contribute to a more harmonious overall design.", "current": "To improve the picture organization, consider redistributing the elements more evenly across the canvas.
