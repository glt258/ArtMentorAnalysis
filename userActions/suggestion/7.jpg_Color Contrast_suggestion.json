For example, you could darken the black areas of the fur and lighten the white areas to create a more pronounced contrast. Additionally, you could use a more vibrant shade of pink for the collar and a brighter yellow for the bell to make them stand out more. Enhancing the green of the ball with a more vivid hue could also help it pop against the dog's fur. Finally, consider adding a subtle background color that contrasts with the dog's fur to make the entire composition more striking.", "current": "To improve the color contrast in the artwork, consider intensifying the colors of the dog's fur and the background.
