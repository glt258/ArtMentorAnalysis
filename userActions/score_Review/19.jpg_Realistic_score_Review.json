{"scores": {"original": 2, "current": 2, "initGPTscore": 2}, "Reviews": {"original": "The artwork demonstrates an attempt at realism but struggles with accurate proportions and detailed textures. The faces and bodies of the figures are simplified and lack detailed features, making them less lifelike. The use of color is vibrant, but the lighting and perspective are inconsistently applied. The fish and the half sun are recognizable but lack depth and detail. The overall composition shows effort, but the execution falls short of creating a convincing realistic depiction.", "current": "The artwork demonstrates an attempt at realism but struggles with accurate proportions and detailed textures.
