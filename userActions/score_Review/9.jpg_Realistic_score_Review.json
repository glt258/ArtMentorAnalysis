{"scores": {"original": 2, "current": 2, "initGPTscore": 2}, "Reviews": {"original": "The artwork demonstrates an attempt at realism but struggles with accurate proportions and detailed textures. The figures of the children and the airplane are recognizable, but they lack the precision and detail needed for a higher realism score. The proportions of the children are somewhat inconsistent, and the textures are simplified. The lighting is not distinctly applied, and the perspective is somewhat flat. While the use of color is vibrant and the composition is dynamic, the overall depiction lacks the depth and detail required for a more lifelike representation.", "current": "The artwork demonstrates an attempt at realism but struggles with accurate proportions and detailed textures.
