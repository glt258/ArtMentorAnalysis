The figures are intentionally exaggerated with elongated limbs and simplified facial features, which adds a whimsical and playful quality to the piece. The bright, contrasting colors and bold outlines further enhance the sense of movement and energy. The deformation is well-integrated into the composition, contributing significantly to the viewer's emotional response. However, some elements, such as the airplane and flowers, could be more cohesively deformed to match the style of the figures. Overall, the deformation is effective and enhances the artistic expression.", "current": "The artwork demonstrates a strong use of deformation to convey a lively and dynamic scene.
