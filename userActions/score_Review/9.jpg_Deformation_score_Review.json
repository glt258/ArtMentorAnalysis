The exaggerated size and vibrant colors of the airplane and the sun, as well as the flowing, abstract lines representing movement and energy, contribute significantly to the viewer's understanding and emotional response. The children's raised hands and the dynamic lines create a sense of unity and celebration. However, some elements, such as the disproportionate sizes of the children and the abstract lines, might feel slightly disjointed from the overall composition. Overall, the deformations are well-integrated and enhance the emotional impact of the piece.", "current": "The artwork effectively uses deformation to express artistic intentions.
