The lines used to depict the airplane, people, and flowers are clear and well-defined, creating a cohesive scene. The colorful smoke behind the plane adds a dynamic element to the piece. However, some areas, such as the integration of the people with the background, could be more cohesive to enhance the overall visual flow. Overall, the line combinations are effective and contribute positively to the artwork.", "current": "The artwork displays good use of line combinations that contribute to the overall composition.
