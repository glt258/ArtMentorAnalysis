The lines used for the facial features and the collar are well-defined, adding to the overall detail and character of the piece. However, some areas, such as the ball and parts of the body, could benefit from more textural variety to enhance the visual interest. Overall, the execution is strong, but there is room for further refinement in certain sections.", "current": "The artwork demonstrates a good range of line textures, particularly in the fur of the dog, which shows a variety of strokes and shading techniques.
