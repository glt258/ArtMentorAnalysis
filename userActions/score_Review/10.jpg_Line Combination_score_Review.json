The lines are vibrant and dynamic, creating a sense of movement and energy, especially with the colorful dragon and the raised arms of the children. The integration of lines is mostly cohesive, though there are a few areas where the lines could flow more smoothly to enhance the visual harmony. Overall, the line combinations effectively support the lively and engaging nature of the piece.", "current": "The artwork displays good use of line combinations that contribute to the overall composition.
