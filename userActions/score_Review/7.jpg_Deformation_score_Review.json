The deformations in the artwork, such as the exaggerated facial features and the somewhat disproportionate body, contribute to the artistic expression by making the dog appear more expressive and engaging. However, these deformations are somewhat disjointed from the overall composition, as the rest of the body remains relatively realistic. This mixed approach results in a moderate impact on the viewer, enhancing the artwork's charm but not fully integrating the deformations into a cohesive artistic statement.", "current": "The artwork features a dog with a pink collar and yellow bell, holding a green ball.
