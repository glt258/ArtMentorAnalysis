{"scores": {"original": 2, "current": 2, "initGPTscore": 2}, "Reviews": {"original": "The artwork demonstrates an attempt at realism, particularly in the depiction of human figures and the colorful dragon. However, the proportions of the figures are not entirely accurate, and the textures are quite simplistic. The lighting and perspective are not consistently applied, which detracts from the overall realism. The use of bright colors and abstract shapes adds a creative touch but further moves the piece away from a lifelike depiction. Overall, the artwork shows effort but lacks the detailed execution needed for a higher realism score.", "current": "The artwork demonstrates an attempt at realism, particularly in the depiction of human figures and the colorful dragon.
