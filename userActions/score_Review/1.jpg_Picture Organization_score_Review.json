The central character is prominently placed on one side of the balance scale, and the various animals are thoughtfully positioned around them, adding interest and guiding the viewer's eye. The balance scale itself is a clever element that connects the character to the stack of books and schoolbag on the other side, creating a visual narrative. However, the right side of the image feels slightly less detailed and could benefit from additional elements to enhance the overall balance. Despite this minor issue, the composition effectively engages the viewer and tells a coherent story.", "current": "The artwork demonstrates good organization with a well-arranged composition.
