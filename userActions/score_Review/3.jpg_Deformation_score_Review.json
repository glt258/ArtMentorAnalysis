The characters and scenes are creatively altered to convey a narrative, with exaggerated expressions and actions that enhance the storytelling. The yellow animal on the brown pillar, the use of different colored grounds, and the whimsical elements like the spring shoes and balloons add a playful and imaginative touch. While the deformations are well-integrated and contribute significantly to the viewer's understanding and emotional response, there are minor elements that could be more cohesive. For instance, the transitions between scenes could be smoother to enhance the overall narrative flow.", "current": "The artwork effectively uses deformation to express artistic intentions.
