The lines are used effectively to create distinct shapes and figures, such as the dragons, birds, and people. The integration of lines to form clouds and the sun adds to the visual interest. However, some areas, particularly where the lines intersect or overlap, could benefit from more cohesion to enhance the overall harmony of the piece.", "current": "The artwork displays good use of line combinations that contribute to the overall composition.
